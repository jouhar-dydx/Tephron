Underutilized EC2 instances are defined as those with:
- CPU utilization < 10% for 3+ consecutive days
- Low network/disk I/O
- High monthly cost despite low usage

Optimization Recommendations:
- Consider downsizing to smaller instance type
- Evaluate use of Spot Instances if workload allows
- Replace with Lambda/Fargate if stateless or short-lived

Underutilized EC2 instances are defined as those that:
- Have CPU utilization < 10% over 3+ days
- Are on-demand when Spot could be used
- Can be replaced with Lambda or Fargate

Recommendation:
- Consider downsizing or switching to Spot
- Use Cost Explorer to forecast monthly spend
